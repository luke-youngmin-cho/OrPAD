**OrPAD (<a>Or</a>chestration <a>P</a>ipeline <a>A</a>uthoring & <a>D</a>evelopment) is a local-first
editor for Markdown, structured data, diagrams, and AI-assisted writing
workflows.**

Open Markdown, JSON, YAML, CSV/TSV, TOML, XML, HTML, Mermaid, INI/conf, `.env`,
logs, and plain text in one app. Each supported format gets a dedicated
editable viewer and toolbar, while the source text stays close at hand.

## Install

| Option | Start here | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Web app | [Open OrPAD Web](https://luke-youngmin-cho.github.io/OrPAD/) | Trying OrPAD with no install |
| Desktop app | [Download from Releases](https://github.com/luke-youngmin-cho/OrPAD/releases) | OS file associations, auto-update, and local file watching |
| Source build | [Build from source](#build-from-source) | Development and custom builds |

### Web

Open [luke-youngmin-cho.github.io/OrPAD](https://luke-youngmin-cho.github.io/OrPAD/).
No account or installer is required.

Chromium-based browsers such as Chrome, Edge, Arc, and Opera support the full
workspace experience through the
[File System Access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/File_System_API):
folder browsing, cross-file search, wiki-link backlinks, and read-write file
access.

Firefox and Safari support single-file open and Save As through normal browser
downloads. Open Folder shows a clear browser-support message instead of failing
silently.

OrPAD Web is also installable as a PWA. Chromium-based browsers show the
native install prompt on a later visit; Safari users get an in-app hint for
Add to Dock or Add to Home Screen. The app shell remains available for offline
launching after install. Network-backed features such as URL fetches, AI
providers, GitHub APIs, and MCP-related actions still require connectivity.

#### Share a file via URL

OrPAD Web can open trusted source URLs directly:

```text
https://luke-youngmin-cho.github.io/OrPAD/?github=nodejs/node/blob/main/README.md
https://luke-youngmin-cho.github.io/OrPAD/?gist=<gist_id>
https://luke-youngmin-cho.github.io/OrPAD/?src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/<ref>/<path>
```

Use the **Share** button to copy a `#fragment=` snapshot link for the current
tab. URL-loaded and fragment-loaded tabs are marked unsaved, so saving always
prompts for a local filename. Only HTTPS URLs are accepted; trusted hosts open
directly, and other hosts ask for confirmation before fetching.

### Desktop

Download the installer for your platform from the
[OrPAD Releases page](https://github.com/luke-youngmin-cho/OrPAD/releases).

The desktop build adds:

- OS-default-app registration for 20+ file extensions
- A file watcher that refreshes the tree on external changes
- Auto-save recovery after restart
- In-app update checks through the GitHub Releases API

### Windows

Run the `.exe` installer from the
[OrPAD Releases page](https://github.com/luke-youngmin-cho/OrPAD/releases)
and follow the setup wizard.

Windows builds support Windows 10/11 x64.

### macOS

Download the `.dmg` from the
[OrPAD Releases page](https://github.com/luke-youngmin-cho/OrPAD/releases).
OrPAD Desktop requires macOS 11 Big Sur or newer because the current
Electron runtime no longer supports Catalina. Catalina users should use
[OrPAD Web](https://luke-youngmin-cho.github.io/OrPAD/) instead.

Mount the `.dmg`, then either launch OrPAD directly from the DMG or drag it
to `/Applications` or another writable location such as `~/Desktop/`.

OrPAD is not signed with an Apple Developer ID yet. On first launch, macOS
may block it with "Apple could not verify OrPAD is free of malware." You
can approve the app once through **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Open
Anyway**, or clear the quarantine flag from Terminal:

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/OrPAD.app   # or wherever you placed it
open /Applications/OrPAD.app
```

The recursive `-cr` is needed because Electron apps contain nested helper
binaries, each with its own quarantine flag. OrPAD opens normally on later
launches.

## Why OrPAD?

Good file viewers usually specialize: JSON Editor Online for JSON, Modern CSV
for CSV, Typora for Markdown, Mermaid Live Editor for diagrams. Five formats
often means five apps, five clipboards, and several browser tabs.

OrPAD is one desktop and web app where every supported format has a
first-class editable viewer.

Every view round-trips through the text editor. Change a cell in the CSV grid
and the underlying text updates; edit the text and the grid refreshes. Scroll
sync works both ways, so cursor movement in the editor follows the preview and
the preview follows the editor.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Ctrl+N | New file |
| Ctrl+O | Open file |
| Ctrl+S | Save |
| Ctrl+Shift+S | Save As |
| Ctrl+W | Close tab |
| Ctrl+Tab | Next tab |
| Ctrl+Shift+Tab | Previous tab |
| Ctrl+B | Bold in Markdown |
| Ctrl+I | Italic in Markdown |
| Ctrl+K | Link in Markdown; waits briefly for the Zen chord |
| Ctrl+K, Z | Toggle Zen Mode |
| Alt+Up / Alt+Down | Move line up / down |
| Shift+Alt+Up / Shift+Alt+Down | Copy line up / down |
| Ctrl+/ | Toggle line comment |
| Ctrl+Shift+/ | Toggle block comment |
| Ctrl+Alt+Up / Ctrl+Alt+Down | Add cursor above / below |
| Ctrl+D | Select next occurrence |
| Ctrl+Shift+L | Select all matching occurrences |
| Ctrl+Shift+[ / Ctrl+Shift+] | Fold / unfold current block |
| Ctrl+T | Toggle TOC sidebar |
| Ctrl+Shift+E | File explorer sidebar |
| Ctrl+Shift+F | Search in files |
| Ctrl+L | Toggle AI sidebar |

The command palette includes `Editor: Toggle Vim Mode`, `Editor: Toggle
Minimap`, and `Editor: Toggle Zen Mode`. Vim mode is persisted in
`localStorage["editor.vim"]`. `Ctrl+L` stays assigned to the AI sidebar, so
editor navigation does not steal that binding.

## Workflows

### Git status

When the open workspace is a Git repository, OrPAD shows the current branch
in the status bar, file badges in the Files sidebar, and change markers in the
editor gutter.

Git commands in the command palette are status-only: refresh, branch switch,
diff against HEAD, and revert current file. Commit, push, pull, fetch, auth,
conflict resolution, and Git LFS are intentionally out of scope for this phase.

Large repositories can make client-side `statusMatrix` scans slow. OrPAD
shows a scanning banner if the initial status load takes more than three
seconds. In the web build, Git status uses browser File System Access handles
and rebuilds its view from disk on each load, which is intended for
small-to-mid-size repositories rather than very large monorepos.

### Snippets

OrPAD ships built-in CodeMirror snippets for Markdown, JSON, YAML, CSV,
Mermaid, and `.env` files. Snippets appear in autocomplete with a `snippet`
tag, can be inserted through `Insert Snippet...` in the command palette, and
support placeholder cycling with Tab / Shift+Tab.

Typing a snippet name with a colon, such as `toc-marker:`, then pressing Tab
expands it inline.

Workspace snippets live at `.orpad/snippets.json` and override the
cross-workspace fallback stored in the app user-data `snippets.json`. The
schema is:

```json
{
  "markdown": [
    { "name": "note", "body": "> **Note** ${0}" }
  ]
}
```

## Build from source

Install dependencies, run the desktop app, or build release artifacts with npm:

```bash
npm install

# Run desktop app in development
npm start

# Build desktop installers for the current platform
npm run dist:win    # Windows NSIS installer (.exe)
npm run dist:mac    # macOS universal DMG (must be run on macOS)

# Build the web app into docs/ for GitHub Pages
npm run build:web       # development bundle
npm run build:web:min   # minified deploy bundle
npm run lh              # Lighthouse PWA check against localhost:4173
```

Useful project files:

- [package.json](package.json) lists available npm scripts.
- [electron-builder.yml](electron-builder.yml) defines desktop packaging.
- [scripts/build-web.js](scripts/build-web.js) builds the GitHub Pages web app.
- [scripts/create-release-manifest.mjs](scripts/create-release-manifest.mjs)
  writes signed release manifests for updater verification.

## Privacy, telemetry, and crash reports

### Usage analytics

OrPAD collects anonymous usage events through
[Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/privacy): session start/end, file
open/save, format bar interactions, and errors.

Collected event properties are limited to non-personal metadata such as file
format, rough file size, platform, and app version. File contents, filenames,
keystrokes, and user identifiers are not recorded.

To opt out:

- Run `localStorage.setItem("analytics-opt-out", "1")` in DevTools and reload.
- On desktop, development and unpackaged runs are always silent; only
  production builds send events.
- A "Send usage data" toggle will be added to Settings before the Phase 1
  release.

### Crash reports

OrPAD integrates [Sentry](https://sentry.io) for crash reporting when a
build provides `SENTRY_DSN`.

When crash reporting is active, Sentry captures unhandled exceptions, promise
rejections, stack traces, recent breadcrumb actions, app version, OS platform,
and Electron/browser version.

OrPAD does not send file contents, document paths, clipboard data,
keystrokes, or other user-generated content. Sentry's default PII scrubbing is
enabled, and a `beforeSend` hook strips breadcrumb messages containing `.env`,
`.key`, or `.pem` fragments before an event leaves the app.

To opt out on desktop, open DevTools with `Ctrl+Shift+I` and run:

```js
localStorage.setItem('sentry-opt-out', '1');
```

Restart the app. Crash reporting stays disabled until you remove the key:

```js
localStorage.removeItem('sentry-opt-out');
```

Current release builds do not assume a baked-in Sentry DSN. If `SENTRY_DSN` is
unset, the app logs one INFO line and disables crash reporting without making
network calls.

For self-hosted or custom builds, create a Sentry project and launch with:

```bash
SENTRY_DSN=https://<key>@<org>.ingest.sentry.io/<project> npm start
```

See [Plausible's privacy policy](https://plausible.io/privacy) and
[Sentry's privacy policy](https://sentry.io/privacy/) for details on how
aggregated analytics and crash data are processed.

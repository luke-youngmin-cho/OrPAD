</p>

A fast, multi-format viewer and editor for Windows, macOS, and the web.
Open Markdown, JSON, YAML, CSV/TSV, TOML, XML, HTML, Mermaid, INI/conf, .env,
log, and plain text in one app — every format gets a dedicated viewer and
toolbar, and every viewer is editable.

**Try it in your browser:** [luke-youngmin-cho.github.io/FormatPad](https://luke-youngmin-cho.github.io/FormatPad/)
— zero install. Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Arc, Opera) get the
full workspace via the File System Access API; Firefox and Safari support
single-file open/save.

## Why FormatPad?

Good file viewers usually specialize — JSON Editor Online for JSON, Modern
CSV for CSV, Typora for Markdown, Mermaid Live Editor for diagrams. Five
formats means five apps, five clipboards, several browser tabs.

FormatPad is **one desktop app where every format has its own first-class,
editable viewer**:

- **JSON** → tree view with JSONPath queries and side-by-side diff
- **CSV / TSV** → spreadsheet grid with sort, filter, column operations
- **Markdown** → split-view live preview with KaTeX math, Mermaid, GFM,
  wiki-style `[[links]]` with backlinks
- **YAML / TOML / INI** → structured tree inspection + cross-format
  conversion
- **XML** → tree view with XPath
- **HTML** → rendered preview with outline, Markdown export
- **Mermaid** → live diagram synced with source
- **.env** → typed key-value table

Every view **round-trips through the text editor** — change a cell in the
CSV grid and the underlying text updates; edit the text and the grid
refreshes. Scroll sync works both ways: cursor movement in the editor
follows the preview and vice versa.

All local. No cloud, no subscription, no account.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Ctrl+N | New file |
| Ctrl+O | Open file |
| Ctrl+S | Save |
| Ctrl+Shift+S | Save As |
| Ctrl+W | Close tab |
| Ctrl+Tab | Next tab |
| Ctrl+Shift+Tab | Previous tab |
| Ctrl+B | Bold (Markdown) |
| Ctrl+I | Italic (Markdown) |
| Ctrl+K | Link (Markdown); waits briefly for the Zen chord |
| Ctrl+K, Z | Toggle Zen Mode |
| Alt+Up / Alt+Down | Move line up / down |
| Shift+Alt+Up / Shift+Alt+Down | Copy line up / down |
| Ctrl+/ | Toggle line comment |
| Ctrl+Shift+/ | Toggle block comment |
| Ctrl+Alt+Up / Ctrl+Alt+Down | Add cursor above / below |
| Ctrl+D | Select next occurrence |
| Ctrl+Shift+L | Select all matching occurrences |
| Ctrl+Shift+[ / Ctrl+Shift+] | Fold / unfold current block |
| Ctrl+T | Toggle TOC sidebar |
| Ctrl+Shift+E | File explorer sidebar |
| Ctrl+Shift+F | Search in files |
| Ctrl+L | Toggle AI sidebar |

The command palette includes `Editor: Toggle Vim Mode`, `Editor: Toggle
Minimap`, and `Editor: Toggle Zen Mode`. Vim mode is persisted in
`localStorage["editor.vim"]`; when Vim normal-mode keys are active, use the
command palette shortcut to toggle it without typing editor text. `Ctrl+L`
stays assigned to the AI sidebar, so editor navigation does not steal that
binding.

### Git status

When the open workspace is a Git repository, FormatPad shows the current
branch in the status bar, file badges in the Files sidebar, and change markers
in the editor gutter. Git commands in the command palette are status-only:
refresh, branch switch, diff against HEAD, and revert current file. Commit,
push, pull, fetch, auth, conflict resolution, and Git LFS are intentionally out
of scope for this phase.

Large repositories can make client-side `statusMatrix` scans slow; FormatPad
shows a scanning banner if the initial status load takes more than three
seconds. In the web build, Git status uses the browser's File System Access
handles and rebuilds its view from disk each load, which is intended for
small-to-mid-size repositories rather than very large monorepos.

### Snippets

FormatPad ships built-in CodeMirror snippets for Markdown, JSON, YAML, CSV,
Mermaid, and `.env` files. Snippets appear in autocomplete with a `snippet`
tag, can be inserted through `Insert Snippet...` in the command palette, and
support placeholder cycling with Tab / Shift+Tab. Typing a snippet name with a
colon, such as `toc-marker:`, then pressing Tab expands it inline.

Workspace snippets live at `.formatpad/snippets.json` and override the
cross-workspace fallback stored in the app user-data `snippets.json`. The
schema is:

```json
{
  "markdown": [
    { "name": "note", "body": "> **Note** ${0}" }
  ]
}
```

## Install

### Web

No install needed — open
[luke-youngmin-cho.github.io/FormatPad](https://luke-youngmin-cho.github.io/FormatPad/).

FormatPad Web is also installable as a PWA. Chromium-based browsers show the
native install prompt on a later visit; Safari users get an in-app hint for
Add to Dock / Add to Home Screen. The app shell remains available for offline
launch/editing after install. Network-backed features such as URL fetches, AI
providers, GitHub APIs, and MCP-related actions still require connectivity and
surface normal error messages while offline.

Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Arc, Opera) get everything the
desktop app offers except OS integration: folder browsing, cross-file
search, wiki-link backlinks, and read-write file access, all through the
[File System Access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/File_System_API).
Firefox and Safari work for single-file open and Save As via a download;
Open Folder surfaces a clear "needs Chromium" message rather than
silently failing.

The web manifest uses relative `start_url`, `scope`, and `file_handlers.action`
values, so the same artifact can be served from GitHub Pages, localhost, or a
future root domain.

#### Share a file via URL

FormatPad Web can open trusted source URLs directly:

```text
https://luke-youngmin-cho.github.io/FormatPad/?github=nodejs/node/blob/main/README.md
https://luke-youngmin-cho.github.io/FormatPad/?gist=<gist_id>
https://luke-youngmin-cho.github.io/FormatPad/?src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/<ref>/<path>
```

Use the **Share** button to copy a `#fragment=` snapshot link for the current
tab. URL-loaded and fragment-loaded tabs are marked unsaved, so saving always
prompts for a local filename. Only HTTPS URLs are accepted; trusted hosts open
directly, and other hosts ask for confirmation before fetching.

### Desktop

Grab the installer for your platform from the
[latest release](../../releases/latest). The desktop build adds
OS-default-app registration for 20+ extensions, a file watcher that
refreshes the tree on external changes, an auto-save recovery on
restart, and the in-app auto-updater.

### Windows

Run the `.exe` installer and follow the setup wizard. Windows builds support
Windows 10/11 x64, and the release pipeline also produces Windows ARM64
installers for Windows 11 ARM devices.

### macOS

FormatPad Desktop requires macOS 11 Big Sur or newer because the current
Electron runtime no longer supports Catalina. Catalina users should use
FormatPad Web in Safari/Chrome/Firefox instead.

Mount the `.dmg` and launch FormatPad directly from the DMG, or drag it to
`/Applications` (or any writable location like `~/Desktop/`) first.

FormatPad isn't signed with an Apple Developer ID yet, so on first launch
macOS blocks it with *"Apple could not verify FormatPad is free of
malware..."* Clear the quarantine flag once from Terminal:

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/FormatPad.app   # or wherever you placed it
open /Applications/FormatPad.app
```

The recursive `-cr` is needed because Electron apps have nested helper
binaries, each carrying a separate quarantine flag — a plain
`xattr -d com.apple.quarantine` on the bundle isn't enough. FormatPad
opens normally on subsequent launches.

With admin rights, an alternative is **System Settings → Privacy &
Security → Open Anyway** once the blocked-app notice appears there.

## Telemetry

FormatPad collects anonymous usage events (session start/end, file open/save,
format bar interactions, errors) via [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/privacy).

**What we collect:** event names and a small set of non-personal properties
(file format, rough file size, platform, app version). No file contents,
filenames, keystrokes, or user identifiers are ever recorded.

**How to opt out:**
- Run `localStorage.setItem("analytics-opt-out", "1")` in DevTools and reload.
- On desktop (Electron), development/unpackaged runs are always silent — only
  production builds send events.
- A "Send usage data" toggle will be added to the Settings UI before the
  Phase 1 release.

See [Plausible's privacy policy](https://plausible.io/privacy) for details on
how aggregated data is processed.

## Telemetry & crash reports

FormatPad integrates [Sentry](https://sentry.io) for crash reporting so that
real-world errors can be diagnosed and fixed faster.

### What we collect

When crash reporting is active, Sentry captures:
- Unhandled exceptions and promise rejections in the main process and renderer.
- A stack trace and breadcrumb log (recent actions leading up to the crash).
- App version, OS platform, and Electron/browser version.

**We do not collect** file contents, document paths, clipboard data, keystrokes,
or any other user-generated content. Sentry's default PII scrubbing is enabled,
and a `beforeSend` hook additionally strips any breadcrumb message containing
`.env`, `.key`, or `.pem` fragments before the event leaves the app.

### Opt-out (desktop)

Open DevTools (`Ctrl+Shift+I`) and run:

```js
localStorage.setItem('sentry-opt-out', '1');
```

Restart the app. Crash reporting will remain disabled until you remove the key:

```js
localStorage.removeItem('sentry-opt-out');
```

> **TODO**: expose a "Send crash reports" checkbox in the Settings UI once one
> is added (tracked as a follow-up to task P0-4).

### Self-hosted / custom builds

Crash reports are only sent when the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable is set at
launch. Current release builds do not assume a baked-in DSN; release pipelines
that want crash reporting must inject and verify their own DSN explicitly.
If you build from source and want your own crash reporting, create a project at
[sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and launch with:

```bash
SENTRY_DSN=https://<key>@<org>.ingest.sentry.io/<project> npm start
```

If `SENTRY_DSN` is unset, the app logs one INFO line and disables all crash
reporting — no network calls are made.

### Privacy policy

See [Sentry's privacy policy](https://sentry.io/privacy/) for details on how
captured data is stored and processed.

## Security

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the security baseline, CSP policy, IPC handler
inventory, localStorage audit, and known follow-ups.

# FormatPad

A fast, multi-format viewer and editor for Windows, macOS, and the web.
Open Markdown, JSON, YAML, CSV/TSV, TOML, XML, HTML, Mermaid, INI/conf, .env,
log, and plain text in one app — every format gets a dedicated viewer and
toolbar, and every viewer is editable.

**Try it in your browser:** [luke-youngmin-cho.github.io/FormatPad](https://luke-youngmin-cho.github.io/FormatPad/)
— zero install. Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Arc, Opera) get the
full workspace via the File System Access API; Firefox and Safari support
single-file open/save.

## Why FormatPad?

Good file viewers usually specialize — JSON Editor Online for JSON, Modern
CSV for CSV, Typora for Markdown, Mermaid Live Editor for diagrams. Five
formats means five apps, five clipboards, several browser tabs.

FormatPad is **one desktop app where every format has its own first-class,
editable viewer**:

- **JSON** → tree view with JSONPath queries and side-by-side diff
- **CSV / TSV** → spreadsheet grid with sort, filter, column operations
- **Markdown** → split-view live preview with KaTeX math, Mermaid, GFM,
  wiki-style `[[links]]` with backlinks
- **YAML / TOML / INI** → structured tree inspection + cross-format
  conversion
- **XML** → tree view with XPath
- **HTML** → rendered preview with outline, Markdown export
- **Mermaid** → live diagram synced with source
- **.env** → typed key-value table

Every view **round-trips through the text editor** — change a cell in the
CSV grid and the underlying text updates; edit the text and the grid
refreshes. Scroll sync works both ways: cursor movement in the editor
follows the preview and vice versa.

All local. No cloud, no subscription, no account.

  grid), YAML/TOML/INI (tree), XML (tree + XPath), HTML (rendered +
  outline), Mermaid (live diagram), .env (key/value table), JSONL/NDJSON
  (grid for homogeneous records)
- Plain text / log fallback with per-format syntax highlighting

### Markdown

- KaTeX math — inline `$...$` and block `$$...$$`
- Mermaid diagrams in fenced ` ```mermaid ` blocks
- `highlight.js` code blocks with auto-detect and copy button
- Wiki-style `[[links]]` with autocompletion and a backlinks panel

### Sidebar
- **Files** — real-time file tree watcher, context menu (new / rename / delete)

## Install

### Web

No install needed — open
[luke-youngmin-cho.github.io/FormatPad](https://luke-youngmin-cho.github.io/FormatPad/).

Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Arc, Opera) get everything the
desktop app offers except OS integration: folder browsing, cross-file
search, wiki-link backlinks, and read-write file access, all through the
[File System Access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/File_System_API).
Firefox and Safari work for single-file open and Save As via a download;
Open Folder surfaces a clear "needs Chromium" message rather than
silently failing.

### Desktop

Grab the installer for your platform from the
[latest release](../../releases/latest). The desktop build adds
OS-default-app registration for 20+ extensions, a file watcher that
refreshes the tree on external changes, an auto-save recovery on
restart, and the in-app auto-updater.

### Windows

Run the `.exe` installer and follow the setup wizard.

### macOS

Mount the `.dmg` and launch FormatPad directly from the DMG, or drag it to
`/Applications` (or any writable location like `~/Desktop/`) first.

FormatPad isn't signed with an Apple Developer ID yet, so on first launch
macOS blocks it with *"Apple could not verify FormatPad is free of
malware..."* Clear the quarantine flag once from Terminal:

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/FormatPad.app   # or wherever you placed it
open /Applications/FormatPad.app
```

The recursive `-cr` is needed because Electron apps have nested helper
binaries, each carrying a separate quarantine flag — a plain
`xattr -d com.apple.quarantine` on the bundle isn't enough. FormatPad
opens normally on subsequent launches.

With admin rights, an alternative is **System Settings → Privacy &
Security → Open Anyway** once the blocked-app notice appears there.

## Telemetry

FormatPad collects anonymous usage events (session start/end, file open/save,
format bar interactions, errors) via [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/privacy).

**What we collect:** event names and a small set of non-personal properties
(file format, rough file size, platform, app version). No file contents,
filenames, keystrokes, or user identifiers are ever recorded.

**How to opt out:**
- Run `localStorage.setItem("analytics-opt-out", "1")` in DevTools and reload.
- On desktop (Electron), development/unpackaged runs are always silent — only
  production builds send events.
- A "Send usage data" toggle will be added to the Settings UI before the
  Phase 1 release.

See [Plausible's privacy policy](https://plausible.io/privacy) for details on
how aggregated data is processed.

## Build

```bash
npm install

# Run desktop app (development)
npm start

# Build desktop installer for the current platform
npm run dist:win    # Windows NSIS installer (.exe)
npm run dist:mac    # macOS universal DMG (must be run on macOS)

# Build the web app into docs/ (GitHub Pages target)
npm run build:web       # dev bundle
npm run build:web:min   # minified bundle for deploy
```

## Telemetry & crash reports

FormatPad integrates [Sentry](https://sentry.io) for crash reporting so that
real-world errors can be diagnosed and fixed faster.

### What we collect

When crash reporting is active, Sentry captures:
- Unhandled exceptions and promise rejections in the main process and renderer.
- A stack trace and breadcrumb log (recent actions leading up to the crash).
- App version, OS platform, and Electron/browser version.

**We do not collect** file contents, document paths, clipboard data, keystrokes,
or any other user-generated content. Sentry's default PII scrubbing is enabled,
and a `beforeSend` hook additionally strips any breadcrumb message containing
`.env`, `.key`, or `.pem` fragments before the event leaves the app.

### Opt-out (desktop)

Open DevTools (`Ctrl+Shift+I`) and run:

```js
localStorage.setItem('sentry-opt-out', '1');
```

Restart the app. Crash reporting will remain disabled until you remove the key:

```js
localStorage.removeItem('sentry-opt-out');
```

> **TODO**: expose a "Send crash reports" checkbox in the Settings UI once one
> is added (tracked as a follow-up to task P0-4).

### Self-hosted / custom builds

Crash reports are only sent when the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable is set at
launch. Official FormatPad releases have a DSN baked in by the release pipeline.
If you build from source and want your own crash reporting, create a project at
[sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and launch with:

```bash
SENTRY_DSN=https://<key>@<org>.ingest.sentry.io/<project> npm start
```

If `SENTRY_DSN` is unset, the app logs one INFO line and disables all crash
reporting — no network calls are made.

### Privacy policy

captured data is stored and processed.
